We also increment the **len_genre** by 1.

    "# Average Number of Installs per Category in Google Play Store\n",
    "\n",
    "For Android applications, we do not have a rating count column but we do have a column called **Installs** which should be a very helpful in determining which categories are most in demand. Therefore, we use the same approach as with the average rating count for IOS genres, in determining the average number of installs per Google Play Store category.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference in the code is that we cannot actually get the precise number of installs. For example, the number of installs in the Google Play dataset include **100,000+** , **1,000,000+**, **100,000,000+** and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in order to actually calculate the average number of installs, we need to replace the **'+'** and **','** with empty strings so we're able to convert the string into a float. Only after are we able to perform the average calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, since 1,000,000+ does not equal 1,000,000 our average number of installs won't be accurate, but would still give us a reasonable value that we can compare for each category. "

    "\n",
    "After taking a closer look at both the App Store average number of ratings and the Google Play store average number of installs, I've come up with two suggestions for our company. Since we're hoping for success on both platforms, I wanted to determine the genres/categories that will have both a high number of ratings from the App Store, as well as a high number of installs from the Google Play Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we examine the average number of ratings data carefully, we notice the top 3 being: **Navigation**, **Social Networking**, and **Reference**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Social** is also a category with a large number of average installs from the Google Play store. However, realizing that giants like Facebook have a large market share, could make things extremely difficult for newcomers getting into the niche. This is why I would advise not to make apps that fit into the social / social networking genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, both **Navigation** and **Books Reference** categories have a decent average number of installs and would be more realistic to capture an audience in one of these categories as there aren't any obvious giants for alternatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would advise our company to make an app geared towards Books and reference, as there's only so much variability you can achieve with Navigation apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would say the best course of action in this regard, is to make an app that is based off a book, comic or manga, and which includes a couple of features for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* characters and their personality/description\n",
    "* map of the setting\n",
    "* jigsaw puzzles\n",
    "* book quizzes\n",
    "* book slang \n",
    "* book discussion forum\n",
    "* chapter summaries\n",
    "* option to allow people to write their own chapter and share with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the app becomes successful, and the book popular, we can potentially move into the gaming sector and do something like **\"Pokemon Go\"**,  allowing a free to play game that is based off the book we're referencing, but also give the opportunity for in app purchases which boosts the potential for profitability."
